# Rogue Like Dungeons

This repository produces a Docker image using [itzg/minecraft-server]() as its base image.

This image does require a volume directory with the Rogue Like Dungeon server files. To learn how to set a container up from scratch, read the contents of [Development](https://github.com/jblevins1991/rogue-like-dungeons/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).
